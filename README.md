ui-edit-v1
==========

A first try at a UI editor. Also, the underlying UI logic itself, which was mostly done in C++ but with an interface
roughly adhering to OpenGL's. The SDL bindings come courtesy from LuaForge (I think), though they were later modified.

I don't recall exactly how functional this is. It was originally meant to be for a specific game, but that fell through.
Much of the UI logic is based on refinements of what I had done in [Vektor Space](http://vektorspace.com/).

This was where I cut my teeth on Lua (along with a borrowed copy of [Game Scripting Mastery](http://www.amazon.ca/Game-Scripting-Mastery-Alex-Varanese/dp/1931841578/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1350370960&sr=1-3),
still in 5.0, so the code may leave a bit to be desired. :) Also, it apparently never occurred to me to give my Lua files
a proper extension. :(
